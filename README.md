# PID-Controller Demo

This project is an interactive PID Controller demo designed to help users learn the concepts of PID control and test out dependencies. The demo allows users to adjust the PID parameters (Kp, Ki, Kd) and observe the effects on the system in real-time.

## Introduction

A PID controller (Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller) is a control loop mechanism widely used in industrial control systems. This demo provides an interactive way to understand how PID controllers work by allowing users to adjust the PID parameters and visualize the system's response.

## Features

- Interactive sliders to adjust PID parameters (Kp, Ki, Kd)
- Real-time visualization of the system's response
- Chart displaying the P, I, and D values over time
- Reset button to reset the system state and PID parameters

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/julianwinking/pid-demo.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd pid-demo
    ```

3. Open [index.html](http://_vscodecontentref_/0) in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

1. Open the [index.html](http://_vscodecontentref_/1) file in your web browser.
2. Use the sliders to adjust the PID parameters (Kp, Ki, Kd).
3. Observe the system's response in the canvas and the chart displaying the P, I, and D values over time.
4. Click the "Reset" button to reset the system state and PID parameters to their default values.
